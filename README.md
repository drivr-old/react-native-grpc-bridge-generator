Creating multiple mappers and briges for react native to a grpc service is painful so we created this tool to ease the development pain and automate the procedure.

## Getting Started

To create the brige file run

```
$ babel test-samples/grpc-sample.proto
```

This will create a files ready to use for communication

```
output/grpcSample.h
output/grpcSample.m
output/grpcSample-action-types.js
output/grpcSample-flow-types.js
output/grpcSample-actions.js
output/grpcSample-react-native-api-client.js
```

## Next Steps

Make mappings for Android and all primitive types.
